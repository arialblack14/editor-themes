Please note this is a very early version - it probably needs a bit of work (PRs accepted!)

Copy the file into your `.emacs.d` folder.

Open `.spacemacs` (or emacs config file if you're not using Spacemacs) and towards the bottom in `defun dotspacemacs/user-config` add the following line:

```
(setq-default dotspacemacs-themes '(codeschool spacemacs-dark))
```

The open Spacemacs, hit `SPACE` and `T` then `n` and it should select it.
