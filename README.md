# Code Editor Themes

A selection of themes for TextMate (1 & 2) Vim, Sublime Text, Atom and Emacs/SpaceMacs!

- CodeSchool Theme - very popular with Rubyists
- Elixify - an elixified theme for Alchemists!

Please note the Elixify theme is in beta and currently only available for TextMate 1 & 2, Sublime and Atom. The Emacs and Vim versions are next on my list.

Feedback and PR's welcome.
