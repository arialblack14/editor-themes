# Code Editor Themes

A selection of themes for TextMate (1 & 2) Vim, Sublime Text and Emacs/SpaceMacs!

- CodeSchool Theme - very popular with Rubyists
- The Alchemist - for Alchemists! (Elixir Developers)

Please note the Alchemist theme is very new, and there are a few things I wanted to include (like string interpolation) but these do not seem to be supported for Elixir in Emacs or Vim.

Feedback and PR's :-)
